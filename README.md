Now that you have had exposure to key concepts related to databases, it is time to learn how to create and interact with databases using Structured Query Language, or SQL!  

SQL is a very valuable skill for a developer to have and is always in demand in the job market. With SQL, you are able to manage relational databases and perform operations on the data within them. Even though you will often use other interfaces to manage data in your database for creating full-stack applications, having knowledge of the fundamentals of SQL will take you a very long way in your journey as a software developer!
