Now that you have had exposure to key concepts related to databases, it is time to learn how to create and interact with databases using Structured Query Language, or SQL!  

SQL is a very valuable skill for a developer to have and is always in demand in the job market. With SQL, you are able to manage relational databases and perform operations on the data within them. Even though you will often use other interfaces to manage data in your database for creating full-stack applications, having knowledge of the fundamentals of SQL will take you a very long way in your journey as a software developer!   

Now that you have had exposure to key concepts related to using SQL to query database tables, it is time to learn how to create and interact with databases using Object Relational Mappers!  


In modern day application development the approach to database creation, management, and interaction is done through the primary coding language rather than through raw SQL. This is called the Code First Approach. In the Code First Approach you are able to create, define, and interact with your database and database tables all through Python. This helps keep things more organized, readable, and doesn't require a developer to be knowledgeable in the smaller intricacies of SQL. By using the code first approach, all developers comfortable with OOP principles can easily interact with the applications database and tables.  

It is important to understand that Object Relational Mappers simply make the interaction between an application and database server easier. Object Relational Mappers are collections of pre-written code that suggest implementation practices and expose functions or methods for data interaction. Under-the-hood ORMs still convert the code to raw SQL, which is then executed on the database. However, the developer often will never see this "under-the-hood" conversion to SQL in their application code.  


Writing and understanding raw SQL is a very valuable skill for a developer to have and is always in demand in the job market. Many applications still actively use raw SQL for database creation and management. This means, even though Object Relation Mappers exist, they are not always suitable for the situation at hand.
